What is React?
"A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces"

Why use React?
"UI State becomes difficult to handle with Vanilla JavaScript."
"Focus on Business Logic, not on preventing your App from breaking."
"Huge Ecosystem, Active Community, High Performance."

React Alternative
"Angular" "React" "Vue"
"jQuery is more about traversing the dom."

Single Page Applications vs Multipage Applications
"SPA - Only ONE HTML page, Content is re-redered on Client"
"MPA - Multiple HTML Pages, Content is redendered on server"
"If you manage the entire page with JavaScript, you never have to go back to the server to reload the page"
"With SPA, you typically only need ONE ReactDOM.render() call."
"With MPA, You need a ReactDOM.render() call per each component."

1. Getting Started
-------------------

-- ES6 Refresher

"let - variable values"
"const - constant value"

"arrow functions"
function printMyName(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
printMyName('Anthony');

"As an arrow function"
const printMyName = name => console.log(name);
printMyName('Anthony');


"Exports and Imports"
Inside a JavaScript file, we can import content from another file.

"Import Syntax Examples"
import person from './person.js'

-or-

import{baseData} from './utility'
import{clean} from './utility'

baseData and/or clean imports is for targetting specific data.
It is also known as "named exports".
If using a named export, you must import using the exact name you are exporting.
If using a default export, you can name them whatever you like as long as the file path is correct.


"Classes"
---------

A class is created with the "class" keyword.
A class can have both "properties" and "methods"
"Properties" are like variables within classes.
"Methods" are like functions within classes.
